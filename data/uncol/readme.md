# List of 5 regular uncolorable graphs

List contains all uncolorable graphs up to 16 vertices. On graphs with less than 14 vertices there was no uncolorable found.

- List of all 5 regular graphs was generated by genreg using this script [generate_5_reg.sh](..%2F..%2Fscripts%2Fgenerator%2Fgenerate_5_reg.sh)
- Than it was filtered using this program [test_col.cpp](..%2F..%2Fscripts%2Ftest_coloring%2Ftest_col.cpp)
